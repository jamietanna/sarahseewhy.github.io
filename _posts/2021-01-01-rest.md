title: Restorative power of rest

One of the things I've learned in my career is that rest can be radical, especially in software development.

There's constant pressure to do more, build more, blog more, be more active on tech social media. This on top of the social and professional responsibilities we all have (forget finding time for simple pleasures).

For many the grind isn't a choice, it's the consequence of having to work twice as hard in order to be perceived as half as qualified. 

Moreover the choice and the ability to slow down, knowing the consequences of slowing down won't be detrimental to career opportunities, isn't a luxury everyone can afford.

When I decide to rest, which I did at the beginning of November, I keep both of these things in mind. To rest is to resist this constant pressure but it's also a privilege.

I rest because it's restorative. It allows me to recharge my batteries and focus on priorities. 

When I first started out as a software developer I wish I'd known how important it was to pace myself, draw boundaries, and yes, take time to slow down. 

I do now.
