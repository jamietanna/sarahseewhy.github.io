It's been a bit of a stressful month, lots of life things going on and not much headspace to write in depth.

Mostly my mind has wandered to the posts I'd like to write when things are less hectic. 

I'll share a few rough thoughts now just to get them down.

### How to build a HumanOps portfolio

I recently read a blog on how to build a DevOps portfolio and thought the project ideas were useful, especially for those starting out in DevOps. But it also got me thinking. 

I agreed with the author's take but had a very strong "yes, and" reaction to the piece.

So much of what I've done and do as a software developer, platform engineer, and SRE relates more to human interactions: communication, change, leadership, culture, interpersonal skills, conflict.

Some of the most important tools I've learned along the way have nothing to do with code and everything to do with psychology. 

I'd love to write a "yes, and" response to the blog with recommendations on how to build a [HumanOps](https://github.com/HumanOps/HumanOps) portfolio.

### Introducing shoutouts

This is an idea I'm marinating on and originated from the tutoring I'm doing at Ada Developer's Academy.

The idea is to create a section on my website, or maybe a series of blog posts, which highlights some of the amazing people I've worked with (a bit like endorsements on LinkedIn). 

I'd ask their permission first, discuss what they'd want me to cover, collaborate with them on the drafts, provide sign off before posting as well as the option to take the post down at any point.

Why do this? Well, blogs are a communication platform with elements of self-promotion. If this is a soap box, how am I using it to create the kind of change we want to see in the world and the tech industry? If all I'm doing is promoting myself how am I contributing to that future?

I'm still mulling over this idea.

### Dolphins vs Octopuses

I was chatting to a friend recently about starting to explore work options following my career break.

In passing, I said "I'm a dolphin, not an octopus" to describe my preference for working within a team on a product instead of parachuting in as an SRE.

I'd like to expand on this idea a bit further.

To be clear: I'm not an octopus hater, I'm just a dolphin looking for a pod.

### The problems I solve

> _You are the solution to a company's problem. Finding a job is about finding the company which has the problem you are the solution to. That's all it is._

A friend said this to my husband recently and it's really stuck with me. I've been on both sides of the hiring table and feel this statement to be so true.

I'd like to write a post about the kind of problems I solve as way to help prospective employers get a sense of whether I'm the solution to their problem(s).

---------------

That's it folks! I may gone for a bit while family visit and we work through the curveball that life threw at us this month.

Hopefully I'll have time over the summer to expand on one or all of those ideas.

Peace and rest up!
