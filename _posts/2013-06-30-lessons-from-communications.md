The internship which started in January turned into a job and it’s now been about six months – an apt time to reflect on what I’ve learned so far.

Financial PR provides exposure to issues I’d never thought I’d encounter, let alone find interesting (well, mildly bemusing). I’ve learned about [cat bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophe_bond) and [dog funds](https://www.moneywise.co.uk/news/2012-09-14/manek-growth-top-dog-fund), pension politics, and investment strategies.

I also get to work on legal and educational issues, promoting new research or highlighting legal cases. There have even been chances to work on a few gender-related issues.

PR, at least in the private sector, is a cross between sales and journalism. We sell stories to journalists, often making their jobs easier by crafting a well written press release (and therefore more likely to accept the story).

That's an assessment of PR as a field, and as a field it's based on a daily grind of phone calls, briefings, and meetings.

Since I’m just starting out the work I do is not representative of communications. I write briefing notes and press releases, fiddle with excel spreadsheets, create powerpoint presentations, and conduct research. I do not however, work with clients or develop communication strategies – I watch others do this and help where I can.

Some of the work peaks my curiosity, some of it’s mundane, but most of it I don’t find particularly engaging.

Although the work is not engaging, learning about ways of working and office life have been valuable. I’ve learned that meticulous organisation pays off, a quiet office is too quiet for me, and one must always ask colleagues if they’d like a cup of tea if one is about to make a “cuppa”.

Some of the most interesting things I’ve learned have to do with aspects of English culture that I’d not been aware of while in grad school: the almost obligatory Friday pub with colleagues, round etiquette, and how to dress for working in the City.
