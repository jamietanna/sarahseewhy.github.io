I never know where the time goes! But here we are at another month's reflection.

### Handing over the reigns 

This month I handed over the infrastructure lead role to a very capable colleague. It was part of my 2021 reflection to step from leadership for awhile.

It felt mixed, I really love tech leading but I also believe in providing leadership opportunities to other team members.

I think I'll miss the role but look forward to what I'll be doing next.

### Focus on individual contribution

In giving up leading I'll get more time to focus on individual contribution.

Again this was something I thought about in my 2021 reflection and I'm glad I've made the decision (although it was difficult).

Focusing more on individual contribution means more headspace for programming and delving into problem-solving.

I think I'm most excited to do day-to-day implementation tasks and get a crack at our list of improvements.

### Organisational shifts

Some tectonic shifts in government mean I now work for an alphabet soup based elsewhere in the Cabinet Office and not GDS.

My day-to-day hasn't changed drastically and it's kind of exciting to be part of something new.

### Currently reading

Indulging in one of my favourite children's books: _The Hounds of the Mórrígan_. A hard to find and thoroughly enjoyable children's fantasy book set in Ireland.
