I'm taking a break from parental leave to drop another quick announcement: I've relocated to Seattle!

After 12 years living in the UK and 10 years living in London, my partner and I decided to take a leap of faith and try living on the other side of the Atlantic.

We're closer to my US family which is amazing, it's a lot of fun seeing them interact with our daughter.

Seattle is a beautiful city. It's incredible to be so close to mountains, forest, lakes, and green spaces. We can't wait to do some exploring and adventuring as a family.

We moved as part of his work and it sadly meant I had to leave the Civil Service. I've decided to continue with the year-long parental leave I'd intended on taking while in the UK. 

My new role is that of "mum" (or I guess "mom"?), at least for the next six-ish months.

I'll be on-and-off writing about tech and SRE things, culture and leadership, and maybe a bit about parenting (I'm already impressed at how being a software engineer influences how we care for our daughter –– perhaps more on that later).

On to the next adventure.
