It's been a hectic few weeks and I've decided to take a step back from writing. One of the best lessons I've learned in my career is when to pause and when to accelerate. Right now it's time to pause, slow down, and reflect. 

Work is unusually active. New developments have left me with some food for thought (more on that at some point).

For now, expect fewer posts (especially week notes) for awhile. I'll be working on the conflict resolution series when I can, but for the most part I'm focused on taking a step back.
