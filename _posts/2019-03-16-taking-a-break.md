It's been a hectic few weeks and I've decided to take a step back from writing. One of the best lessons I've learned in my career is when to pause and when to accelerate. Right now it's time to pause, slow down, and reflect. 

Work is unusually active with new developments which has left me with some food for thought (more on that at some point).

For now, expect fewer posts (especially week notes) and be patient. I'll pick up the writing again.
