title: What leadership means to me

Recently my team lead moved on to a new position at another organisation. It's been a real joy working with him and his departure got me thinking about what makes a good leader.

I've had the privilege of working with a number of strong leaders at the company. Each brought different skill sets to their respective roles but there were a few things that stood out. 

### Listening

Every leader I've worked with has been an exceptional listener. Perhaps without realising it they practiced [active listening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening). 

Most importantly I've walked away from conversations feeling like my opinion mattered. Even when I was the least knowledgeable person in the room, they focused on my input. 

This made it easier for me to take bigger interpersonal risks, suggest ideas I would've previously kept to myself, and volunteer for tasks that I'd thought were too intimidating.

Their listening encouraged the feeling they had confidence in me, which in turn increased the confidence I had in myself.

### Accountability + Honesty

I value accountability. I value when folks own up for when they screw up.

One of the things I've loved about my team lead and our last CTO was the way they held themselves accountable for their actions, choices, and mistakes. They never shied away from honestly introspecting and sharing that introspection with the group. 

It encouraged me to hold myself accountable, admit where I could've done better, and talk about what I would do differently next time.
 
### Support + Guidance 

Feeling supported helps us have the courage to take risks. We know if we fail someone will catch us, not berate us.

My team lead supported my interest in team dynamics and psychology. This support helped me feel confident in taking a course on Conflict Transformation, lead a series of seminars, and [turn those tech talks into blog posts]({% post_url 2019-04-10-learning-about-conflict-transformation-1 %}).

An element of that support has been the guidance he's provided. We met weekly to discuss what's going in the team, my professional development, and any questions or concerns I have. 

I felt challenged by his questions, valued for my input, and at all times supported.

### Whole Self + Vulnerability

I believe leaders who value and live the idea of bringing your whole self to work create environments where people can grow and thrive.

It's what I've experienced over the last year.

Being fully myself at work, leaning into my strengths, identifying where I want to grow has led to some of the most fulfilling and purposeful work I've every experienced.

I believe it also builds trust and social bonding.

When I see leaders bring their whole selves to work, especially when they demonstrate vulnerability, it seems to create this connection, both individually and at a group level. This is backed up by [research](https://hbr.org/2014/12/what-bosses-gain-by-being-vulnerable) and is sometimes referred to as the ["vulnerability loop"](https://ideas.ted.com/how-showing-vulnerability-helps-build-a-stronger-team/).

Leaders who normalise vulnerability build a foundation of trust in a team, this makes it easier for individuals to take interpersonal risk which in turn encourages psychological safety (see Amy Edmondson's [Fearless Organisation](https://fearlessorganization.com)).
