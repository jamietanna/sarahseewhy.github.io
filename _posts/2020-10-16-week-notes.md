### Katas

I picked up programming in my downtime again for the first time in a year. 

Just katas for now, mostly in Java because it still feels the most comfortable for me.

It was way more fun than I expected.

Most of my time these days is spent click-ops-ing in AWS or writing terraform. I'd forgotten how joyful problem solving _code_ could be, even if it's just little problems.

I also underestimated how much I missed the red-green-refactor cycle of TDD.

The next step is to use this time to practice python.

### Power of laughter

This week my team had its first [Fika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_culture#Sweden) and team lunch.

There was a lot of laughter, it was great.

But it also got me thinking of an [NPR story](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/09/922375817/the-sound-of-laughter-can-be-key-in-determining-people-s-relationships) I heard this week on the psychology of laughter.

Laughter is a "play signal", it signals to a deep part of our brains that we are in a safe space.

It also brings us together –– especially shared laughter.

A [bunch](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3302270/) [of](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03330380) [research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pere.12095) indicates shared laughter helps people feel more connected in a group. 

Some [social psychology researchers](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_laughter_brings_us_together#thank-influence) think this could because shared laughter encourages "perceived similarity" (a connection booster) between people.

### Can't let it go

I've got two this week.

The first is Brené Brown's [podcast on the psychology of burnout](https://brenebrown.com/podcast/brene-with-emily-and-amelia-nagoski-on-burnout-and-how-to-complete-the-stress-cycle/), an interview with Emily and Amelia Nagoski, authors of [_Burnout_](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1116668/burnout/9781785042096.html).

The interview focused on how we experience and <ins>hold</ins> feelings and stress somatically (in our body).

This connects to what I've read about trauma as well, from Resmaa Menakem's [_My Grandmother's Hands_](https://centralrecoverypress.com/product/my-grandmothers-hands-racialized-trauma-and-the-pathway-to-mending-our-hearts-and-bodies-paperback) on racialised trauma to Bessel van der Kolk's [_The Body Keeps the Score_](https://www.besselvanderkolk.com/resources/the-body-keeps-the-score) on the impact of trauma on the body and brain.

The second can't-let-it-go was stumbling on the work of coder and developer advocate [Lola Odelola](https://twitter.com/lolaodelola), founder of [blackgirl.tech](https://blackgirl.tech/).

I've especially enjoyed exploring her blog [lostinthesource](https://lostinthesource.com/) (["Demystifying WebRTC By Calling Beyoncé"](https://lostinthesource.com/blog/demistifying-webrtc-calling-beyonce/) is brilliant and exactly what I needed to read as I explore FreeRadius and how wifi works).
