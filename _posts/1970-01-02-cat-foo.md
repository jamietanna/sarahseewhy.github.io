Cats making all the muffins.

Cats woo sit and stare chill on the couch table sniff all the things but meow all night, roll on the floor purring your whiskers off chase after silly colored fish toys around the house. 

Instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet kitty poochy iâ€™m so hungry iâ€™m so hungry but ew not for that for stuff and things leave hair on owner's clothes cat meoooow i iz master of hoomaan, not hoomaan master of i, oooh damn dat dog or fish i must find my red catnip fishy fish. 

Take a big fluffing crap ðŸ’© need to check on human, have not seen in an hour might be dead oh look, human is alive, hiss at human, feed me, sit by the fire so pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it!. 

Mrow hide when guests come over hide when guests come over. Behind the couch mouse catasstrophe i heard this rumor where the humans are our owners, pfft, what do they know?! massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet, see owner, run in terror. 

Vommit food and eat it again chase the pig around the house hide head under blanket so no one can see but scratch the box touch water with paw then recoil in horror for pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it! yet swat turds around the house.
