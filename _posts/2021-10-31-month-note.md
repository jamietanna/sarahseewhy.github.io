It feels weird _not_ thinking about or working on the service assessment. Here's a quick summary of where my mind has been the last month.

### Thinking about our systems

The service assessment helped me view our system holistically and it surfaced more improvement work we can do. I've been thinking about where we can iterate on the improvements we've already done and develop a longer term plan for the service.

I just wish I had more hours in the day for all the work I'd like to do!

### Looking ahead

Complicating these iterations will be a forced change to our CI/CD. 

Due to external factors, unfortunately outside of our control, we have to migrate to a slightly different CI/CD system (self-managed Concourse) and then potentially complete a migration to a managed service.

The tooling isn't confirmed yet but I'm looking at Github Actions and AWS CI/CD options. 

Exploring tooling is an interesting experience in the public sector because we must factor in alignment with other department teams. If every team uses a different CI/CD it creates a myriad of challenges. 

It's one of the reasons GDS created The GDS Way and Reliability Engineering pages.

### Currently reading

I'm zipping through [_Premonition_](https://www.norton.com/books/9780393881554) by Michael Lewis. 

It's about the COVID-19 pandemic and I don't really want to say more because I'd spoil the riveting story telling (Lewis is one of the best story tellers I've ever read).
