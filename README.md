## Technology 
This site is gratefully built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). 

## Design
The page's design is based on the Hyde theme:

> Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
