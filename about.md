I’m a cultural historian of gender and computer science turned infrastructure developer and aspiring Chief Joy Officer. In my life I've also done a bit of teaching and dabbled in communications.

I think extreme programming is the cat’s pajamas, site reliability engineering is swell, and teamwork is the most exciting part of any job. 

I’m always on the lookout for companies with a common purpose, whose leaders champion openness, accountability, belonging, and problem solving.

### what I value

#### 🔀 the intersection of tech and culture
This is the sweet spot for me, where I get my purpose. I like technical problem solving, I always will, but I love questions of culture and team dynamics. Effective communication is what makes good software development possible.

#### 🌈 advocating for diversity, inclusivity, and anti-racism
I became a software developer to unlearn the stereotypes about women in STEM I'd internalised growing up. Now that I'm here, I want to build organisations which are diverse, inclusive, and anti-racist. Every day.

#### 👐 curious, collaborative people who practice vulnerability
For me, these are the core elements of a high performing team, one that's grounded in joy, resilience, and the ability to take interpersonal risk. They're also a lot of fun.

#### 🌱 growing the team around me
Over time this is what I've realised brings me true joy at work: supporting someone's self-discovery, growth, and self-defined success. Seeing the potential in every person and working to bring out the best in each other.

### I’ve been told I’m good at:

#### 💫 bringing joy to an organisation
I'm a joyful person, I can't really help it. I learned to be joyful after a near fatal car crash in my twenties. I think tough times encourage us to dig deep, and when I dug I found joy.

#### ⏲ facilitating gatherings 
From action-focused to organic discussions I love facilitating group gatherings. I typically run a tight ship, no longer than 30 minutes, but also appreciate the importance and value of in-depth, mediated conversations.

#### 🗓 communicating technical goals and progress
I love this part of my job: communicating complex ideas to an audience, making the inaccessible accessible. I draw visuals and build analogies. My favourite was the CentOS 7 Line: a tube map visual guide to our progress upgrading OS versions.
 
#### 🗣 public speaking and teaching
The freest I've ever felt is in front of a group, teaching or speaking on what I'm passionate about. It feels like I'm flying.

#### 📈 developing SLxs
I do enjoy these puzzles. I like the emphasis on the end user experience, and building infrastructure with that as the foundation. I also appreciate the complexity, though it can drive me up the wall. 

#### 👥 practicing XP
For me, [eXtreme Programming (XP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) encourages agency, mastery, and purpose in a team. It's not fit for every team or organisation, it's one tool out of many...but it's my favourite tool.

#### 💗 pastoral care and empathetic listening
I firmly believe in the power of vulnerability to create social bonds of trust. I value and practice empathy and active listening (it's a muscle, you gotta practice). Every interaction is a chance to be part of someone reaching towards the best version of themselves.

#### 🛠 problem solving
I'm a problem solver at heart. Even as cultural historian I got a thrill from contemplative analysis. I then got  hooked on the exhilaration of solving things in code. My favourite part is breaking problems down into smaller pieces and experimenting with solutions.

#### 🧭 intuitive technical direction
I'm a bit shy about this feedback because I think it speaks to the caliber of the people I've had the privilege to work with. What I _do_ find is that my intuition on a technical direction is often correct, despite my internal critic. Perhaps I should trust myself more.
 
#### 🙋‍♀️ ‍asking the right questions
One of my favourite quotes is "seek first to understand, then to be understood". I ask a lot of questions, perhaps it comes from my training as a historian.

#### 😆 laughing
I have a funny laugh. It's hard to describe. I squeak.
