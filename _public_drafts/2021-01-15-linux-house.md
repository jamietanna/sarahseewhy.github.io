Have you ever thought about mapping the Linux directory structure on to rooms in a house?

I have.

In fact, I've thought about this a lot over the last few years.

The first time I `ssh`'d on to a machine it felt like I was entering a house for the first time. Every time I `cd`'d into a directory it was as if I was opening a door into a new room. Listing the contents of a directory was like inspecting the furniture.

I found it both fascinating and infuriating.

There was always something new to discover but none if it made sense to me. Why were some files in `lib` but others in `bin`? What did `etc` stand for? What was each directory's purpose...and why?

This confusion felt particularly frustrating when I was trying to find things on a server, I didn't know where to start. It was like trying to find a blender in a house but not knowing which room was the kitchen.

My solution was to lean into the house analogy: imagine the Linux directory system as a house. Each room had a purpose which would correspond to a directory's purpose.

I was inspired to create my own Linux House by my love of cross-section house illustrations. Stuff like [Leo Hartas's _Apartment Book_](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/2336447.The_Apartment_Book):
