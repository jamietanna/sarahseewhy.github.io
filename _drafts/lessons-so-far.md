The internship which started in January turned into a job and it’s about time to reflect on what I’ve learned so far.

Financial PR provides exposure to issues I’d never thought I’d encounter, let alone find interesting (well, mildly bemusing). I’ve learned about [cat bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophe_bond) and [dog funds](https://www.moneywise.co.uk/news/2012-09-14/manek-growth-top-dog-fund), pension politics, and investment strategies.

I also get to work on legal and educational issues, promoting new research or highlighting legal cases. There have even been chances to work on a few gender-related issues.

From what I can tell PR, at least in the private sector, is a cross between sales and journalism. We sell stories to journalists, trying to make their jobs easier by sending over press releases. When I read newspapers now I've begun to notice quotes or bylines which I'm pretty sure have been pulled from a press release.

That's an assessment of PR as a field, and as a field it's based on a daily grind of phone calls, briefings, and meetings.

Since I’m just starting out, the work I do only gives me a foundational view of comms. I write briefing notes and press releases, fiddle with excel spreadsheets, create powerpoint presentations, and conduct research. I do not however, work with clients or develop communication strategies – I watch others do this and help where I can.

Some of the work peaks my curiosity, some of it’s painfully mundane, and most of it I don’t find particularly engaging.

Although the work is not as engaging as I'd hoped, learning about ways of working and office life have been valuable. I’ve learned that meticulous organisation pays off, a quiet office is too quiet for me, and one must always ask colleagues if they’d like a cup of tea if one is about to make a “cuppa”.

Some of the most interesting things I’ve learned have to do with aspects of English culture that I’d not been aware of while in grad school: the almost obligatory Friday pub with colleagues, round etiquette, and how to dress for working in the City.
