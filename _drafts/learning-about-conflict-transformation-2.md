title: Conflict transformation: styles of conflict
date: 2019-04-10

<sub>In 2018 I took a course on conflict transformation, I wrote about why and how [here]({% post_url 2019-02-26-conflict-is-hard-intro %}). This second post explores 'conflict styles' and how those styles exist in context. It's a long-format post so grab a hot beverage and get comfy.</sub>
