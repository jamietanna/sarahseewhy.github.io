### How would you describe yourself as a developer?

I'm pragmatic, curious, determined, and cheerful –– a combination of Leslie Knope from _Parks and Recreation_ and Captain Janeway from _Star Trek: Voyager_. 

### What would you say is your "specialism"?

I'm fascinated by the interplay between culture and code-writing, and am driven to better understand the human aspects of software development as well as the technological.

I'm also grounded in my love of problem-solving, my curiosity, and my mission to carve out a space for developers who relish thinking critically about code _and_ the cultures in which it’s developed.
