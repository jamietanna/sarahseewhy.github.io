### How did you get in to programming?

So I'm cultural historian of gender turned software developer. Bit of a weird one.

As a historian, I focused on gender in education and ultimately specialised in constructions of masculinities in computer science. 

While developing a PhD proposal on the impact of gender norms on women’s pursuit of careers in technology, I was shocked to see a version of my own experience. 

A [growing body]() of [research]() indicates girls in the 1990s/2000s grew up believing that computers were a "boys' thing" (these studies focus on the UK/US, it's [different elsewhere in the world]()).

When I was growing up, computer stuff, anything [STEM]() really, was something my brother did, something the boys I knew did. Not something I did.

I was the kid who tinkered with arts and crafts, loved organising, and was fascinated by culture. I fundamentally did not believe I belonged in the world of science, engineering, or maths -- forget technology.

Fast forward fifteen years. When I read about women in the technology industry (or the lack thereof) I confronted the realisation I’d internalised the gender stereotypes and narratives I was researching.

I was appalled. Then determined.

As a feminist, I decided one way to live my activism was to challenge these stereotypes and narratives and do what I’d never imagined I'd do: become a software developer. 

I wanted to fight every internal voice that said "you can't do this", refute every experience growing up that reinforced the idea that I didn't belong in tech.

In 2014 I graduated from the software intensive course [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) and began my career as a software developer.

### How would you describe yourself as a developer?

A combination of Mary Poppins, Moana, and Dory from _Finding Nemo_. 

What do I mean by that?

I'm pragmatic, no-nonsense, determined, and sometimes painfully optimistic.

I also deeply connect with Mo's character from _Wall-E_, especially when it comes to refactoring. I swear this is footage of me tidying up code:

### Describe the way you prefer to work
### What would you say is your "specialism"?

I'm fascinated by the interplay between culture and code-writing, and am driven to better understand the human aspects of software development as well as the technological.

I'm also grounded in my love of problem-solving, my curiosity, and my mission to carve out a space for developers who relish thinking critically about code _and_ the cultures in which it’s developed.
