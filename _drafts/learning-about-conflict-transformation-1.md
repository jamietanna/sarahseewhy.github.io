_In 2018 I took a course on conflict transformation, I wrote about why and how [here](). This first post introduces the concept of conflict transformation. I'll talk a bit about definitions of conflict before delving into how conflict transformation unpacks the term and why that's important. It's a long-format post so grab a hot beverage and get comfy._

### What is conflict transformation?

[Conflict transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_transformation) is an approach to conflict which emphasises the importance of conflict in communication and its value as a potential catalyst for transformative change. 

If this all sounds a bit academic, let's compare conflict transformation with something a bit more familiar: conflict resolution.  

| Conflict Resolution | Conflict Transformation |
| :-------------:|:-------------:|
| End an unwanted conflict  | End something destructive and create something constructive |
| Content-centered | Relationship-centered |
| Seeks to de-escalate conflict | Views conflict as a dynamic part of communication |

Conflict resolution focuses on reducing, mitigating, or defusing conflicts. In contrast, conflict transformation seeks to get at the root causes of conflict and focuses on the potential for change conflict can bring.
