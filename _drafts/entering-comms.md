title:  "Entering...communications?"

I have a job. Well, internship. I’m starting an experiment in communications (public relations) at a London agency. 
The focus will be education and law, I hope.

Why choose communications? Of all the people I interviewed about their work, I was most impressed by the women and men in communications – especially those who worked for non-profits. 

It seems like the profession matches most of the criteria I had for what I want to do. I can also start in the private sector and use my experience to eventually transfer to an organisation closer to my interests and values. 

I will be writing (hopefully, it is internship after all), reading new material, and working with a team of colleagues.

The work sounds challenging; some of it will involve finance which I’m less familiar with than 19th and 20th century gender history or feminist theory.

Outside learning about finance I have three things I'd like to achieve:

- Learn whether I enjoy this. Is this a career I could have for six months, a year, ten years?
- Have a salary. I’ve mentioned this before, but there are bills that need paying.
- Learn what it’s like compromise a desire for activism with the need to make a living.

Besides that I’m trying to keep an open mind. This is not the future I envisioned for myself. There’s a line from _The Impossible Will Take Awhile_ that springs to mind: “How to be a happy warrior in an institution with nowhere near the required sense of urgency?” I think that’s the question I'd like find an answer to.
     
So what's next? I move to London, find a flat in city I’ve not lived in since I was six years old, starting making a life.
