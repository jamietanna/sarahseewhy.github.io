I started this experiment with a goal of finding out whether communications could be something I’d pursue as a career. It seemed the type of work which fit with my skills as well as offering a path to working in the non-profit sector.

After six months I’ve decided the answer is this is not for me. Despite, or perhaps because of, the lessons I’ve learned while working PR I’ve decided to move on.

Why am I moving on? There are a few major factors and a host of minor ones. 

The primary reason is the work is not fulfilling enough, both the day-to-day tasks and the broader lack of a sense purpose. I want to be making a difference and currently I’m not. 

My hope going in to this experience was that I’d be able to find the work engaging enough to stay in the private sector until I could find a job which inspired me. This hasn’t happened, nor do I think it will. 

It’s hard to articulate, but this job and this field just don’t feel like “me”. I don’t think I realised how big of a factor this would be going in. I still strongly feel like I’m a student of history, that I belong in academia, not at a financial PR agency in the City.

The shoes also hurt.
